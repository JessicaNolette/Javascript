//Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?

Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:

The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
Each year following equates to 4 dog years.//

// var for age
var myAge = 22
// var for early years 
var earlyYears = 2
// dogs life in years
earlyYears = earlyYears * 10.5
// set variable later years
laterYears = myAge - 2
//Use the multiplication assignment operator to multiply and assign in one step.
laterYears *= 4
// test your work along the way
console.log(earlyYears)
console.log(laterYears)
// calculate your age in dog years
myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears
// create name variable and set to lowercase
var myName = ("Jessica" .toLowerCase())
console.log(myName)
// print human age to dog age conversion
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`)
